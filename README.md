Flower Classifier using PyTorch and Transfer Learning
This is an update version of the old classifier project linked here: https://github.com/jaintj95/FlowerClassifierOld  
In this project I've added python scripts that allow the project to be used as an app.  

Checkpoint not uploaded due to file-size limits set by github.
